## Hi 👋 I'm Kirvl

Fullstack developer with a strong focus on backend.

I mainly work with web technologies, specializing in backend development,
but I also build side projects outside of web development to maintain and
deepen my core language knowledge.

I actively experiment, learn, and create projects of different types to improve
my overall engineering skills.  
Feel free to explore my profile and repositories — each project represents
practical experience and learning.
